# Chess Website

## Goal 
The goal of the website to display chess tournaments for potential players. The tournaments should only include over-the-board (OTB) tournaments. 
The tournaments should include classical tournaments as well as Blitz and Rapid tournaments. It should contain all tournaments world wide. 
The tournaments and all their information should be stored in a PostgreSQL database. 
The database should be connected to a website, where the user sees a world map with flags for individual tournaments. Additionally, the user should have several filter (geography, date, type of tournaments etc.) to filter all the tournaments.
